    "description" : "Hi, my name is Alessia.<br/> I'll graduate in Computer Engineering @Polytechnic University of Turin this March.<br><br>From 2017 to the beginning of 2019 I took a pause from my studies and moved to Ireland, where I started working, lately as a Web Implementation Specialist for the Google Tag Team in Dublin. Last January I decided to come back to Italy in order to complete my studies. In the last months of University I worked as a Front End Developer (Vue.js).<br><br>In my spare time I enjoy taking online programming courses and writing about what I've learned. I'm really passionate about development, web development in particular.",
